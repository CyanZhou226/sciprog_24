# Practical 8
In this practical, we explore recursive functions by implementing two different approaches to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. We use both the iterative and recursive methods, focusing on understanding how recursion works in practical applications.

## compile

gcc -o exercise_8 exercise_8.c

## Excute

./exercise_8

## RESULT:

Please enter two positive integers:

10

8

IterativeGCD(10, 8) = 2

RecursiveGCD(10, 8) = 2
